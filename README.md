# BasicCalculator
### *This is mostly a learning experiment*
**My first adventure into Java: a very basic calculator.**

This project is my first step into Java coding, and it consists of a very basic calculator that, when finished, should resemble something like, for example, the calculator that comes preinstalled with Windows *(in fact, that's the calculator I'm using as a reference for the design of this application.)*

Bear in mind that I only started teaching myself Java a few days before opening this repository, so my methods are anything but perfect. Therefore, if you have a suggestion on what I might do or how I can improve, please, don't hesitate to let me know!

This silly little project might never be finished, but I love the challenge it implies!
